            height="238">I am the Network Administrator for the Multistate Tax Commission. The
          Multistate Tax Commission is an intergovernmental state tax agency
          working on behalf of states and taxpayers to facilitate the equitable
          and efficient administration of state tax laws that apply to multistate
          and multinational enterprises. We have a geographically dispersed
          work force of tax auditors and legal staff. Our headquarters office in Washington DC
          houses our data center as well as 15 support staff. Our audit staff conducts sales
          and use as well as income tax audits on predominately Fortune 100 companies. Our legal
          staff provides amicus briefs to various state Supreme Courts as well as the Supreme
          Court of the United State. Some of the most noteworthy court decisions that our
          legal staff has provided briefs for are Gillette v. California Franchise Tax Board
          and most recently South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. It is my job to ensure that all members
          of the staff have a computer that is working properly and that provides secure access
          to the Commissions data center. I am taking this class to learn how to make changes
          to applications that we are currently running and to create new applications as the
          need for them arises.</p>

        <p>That covers my 'work' life, now onto my personal life. I joined the Navy directly out of
          high school. I spent 16 years in the submarine service. I have spent 94 consecutive days
          under water. I have 2 daughters. One is 30 the other is 23. My oldest daughter has blessed
          me with three grand daughters. The oldest is 13 and the twins are 2. My youngest daughter
          just graduated from The College of William and Mary with a Masters in Business Analytics.
          She works for one of the big 5 accounting firms and is based in Alexandria. I enjoy meeting
          her for lunch (which I always end up paying for) to discuss her upcoming wedding in October.
          My hobbies are woodworking and cycling. I am looking forward to warmer weather so I
          can get back on my bike. The type of cycing that I do is called <a href="https://rusa.org"
            target="_blank">randonneuring.</a> It is long distance,
          unsupported cycling. The longest that I have cycled in one day is 134 miles. This seems like a lot
          but it pales in comparison to the accomplishments of others that I ride with. Several members of our
          bike club have completed The <a href="http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/" target="_blank">Race Across
            America</a> and
          last month one of the club members rode 405.82 miles in 24 hours at <a href="http://www.bikesebring.org/"
            target="_blank">24 hours of Sebring.</a>
