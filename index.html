                        height="238">I am the Network Administrator for the Multistate Tax Commission. The
                    Multistate Tax Commission is an intergovernmental state tax agency
                    working on behalf of states and taxpayers to facilitate the equitable
                    and efficient administration of state tax laws that apply to multistate
                    and multinational enterprises. We have a geographically dispersed
                    work force of tax auditors and legal staff. Our headquarters office in Washington DC
                    houses our data center as well as 15 support staff. Our audit staff conducts sales
                    and use as well as income tax audits on predominately Fortune 100 companies. Our legal
                    staff provides amicus briefs to various state Supreme Courts as well as the Supreme
                    Court of the United State. Some of the most noteworthy court decisions that our
                    legal staff has provided briefs for are Gillette v. California Franchise Tax Board
                    and most recently South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. It is my job to ensure that all members
                    of the staff have a computer that is working properly and that provides secure access
                    to the Commissions data center. I am taking this class to learn how to make changes
                    to applications that we are currently running and to create new applications as the
                    need for them arises.</p>

                <p>That covers my 'work' life, now onto my personal life. I joined the Navy directly out of
                    high school. I spent 16 years in the submarine service. I have spent 94 consecutive days
                    under water. I have 2 daughters. One is 30 the other is 23. My oldest daughter has blessed
                    me with three grand daughters. The oldest is 13 and the twins are 2. My youngest daughter
                    just graduated from The College of William and Mary with a Masters in Business Analytics.
                    She works for one of the big 5 accounting firms and is based in Alexandria. I enjoy meeting
                    her for lunch (which I always end up paying for) to discuss her upcoming wedding in October.
                    My hobbies are woodworking and cycling. I am looking forward to warmer weather so I
                    can get back on my bike. The type of cycing that I do is called <a href="https://rusa.org"
                        target="_blank">randonneuring.</a> It is long distance,
                    unsupported cycling. The longest that I have cycled in one day is 134 miles. This seems like a lot
                    but it pales in comparison to the accomplishments of others that I ride with. Several members of our
                    bike club have completed The <a href="http://www.raceacrossamerica.org/" target="_blank">Race Across
                        America</a> and
                    last month one of the club members rode 405.82 miles in 24 hours at <a
                        href="http://www.bikesebring.org/" target="_blank">24 hours of Sebring.</a>
